Ridership dataset

This dataset is comprised of ridership data for each public transit system in the world, where available. The sources consulted for this dataset include international transportation organizations (e.g. American Public Transportation Association), public transit agencies, municipal and state-level statistics agencies, and railway companies. The dataset has four distinct variables: All Public Transit, Heavy Rail Ridership, Bus Ridership and Light Rail Ridership. Each variable records the number of linked or unlinked passenger trips taken each year in a public transit system, for a given mode of transportation. An unlinked trip is counted each time a passenger boards a transit vehicle. A linked trip is counted once per trip, from the origin to the destination of the passenger, and disregards if or how many times they transfer. The decision to count linked or unlinked trips was pre-determined by each above mentioned source.

All Public Transit records the total number of passengers that used any mode of transportation in the transit system of a given city (e.g. heavy rail subways, buses, streetcars, etc.). Heavy Rail Ridership records the number of passengers that used the subway in a given city. The APTA formally defines this type of transportation as any service “operating on an electric railway with the capacity for a heavy volume of traffic.”1 Bus Ridership records the number of passengers that used the public bus service in a given city. Note: private bus transportation services are not included in this number. Light Rail Ridership records the number of passengers that used the subway in a given city. The APTA formally defines this type of transportation as any service “operating passenger rail cars singly (or in short […] two-car or three-car trains) on fixed rails in right-of-way that is often separated from other traffic for part or much of the way.”2
